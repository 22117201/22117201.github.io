<h3>Unit Introduction</h3>
<p>Have you ever viewed a website and wondered how it was created? Many different elements can be included in the website, such as text, graphics, animation, video and programs (client-side computer scripts). Many websites also contain sophisticated interactive features such as database search facilities, online purchasing and messaging. To be successful, a website must be visually interesting, while remaining easy to use. With the internet being central to how most organisations and individuals communicate and do business, the creation and maintenance of websites is an important job role. There is a strong demand in the job market for web developers with appropriate technical and creative skills. For instance, a web-developer is a technical role involved with designing and developing websites, a content manager is responsible for keeping a website up to date and a search engine optimisation specialist encourages user traffic from internet search engines to specific websites. This unit investigates the features and uses of websites by exploring what they are and how their integrated components and applications interact with each other. Also, learn how to design, develop and test a website for a brief. Once this is completed you will review your website, having obtained feedback from others.</p>
