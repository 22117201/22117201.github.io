<h3>Introduction text About English and Maths lessons I've had in college Cambria</h3>
<p>During my time at Cambria College, I participated in English lessons that helped strengthen my communication, writing, and reading skills. These sessions focused on improving grammar, spelling, and sentence structure, as well as developing confidence when writing formal documents like emails, reports, and presentations. I also practised group discussions which supported my ability to express ideas in both academic and professional settings. These skills have been very useful in writing up coursework and communicating effectively in IT-related tasks.<br>
In my Maths lessons, I worked on developing my understanding of core topics such as percentages, ratios, algebra, and data handling. These lessons helped improve my problem-solving skills and showed how maths applies in real-life and technical situations. For example, I used numeracy when comparing prices, measuring components, or calculating costs in projects. The logical thinking and accuracy I gained through Maths have supported my work in IT and other subjects, particularly when following step-by-step processes or analysing information.

<h3>My Maths Lessons</h3>
    <p>
      At Cambria College, my Maths lessons helped me build strong foundational skills in topics such as percentages,
      ratios, basic algebra, and data handling. These lessons improved my problem-solving and logical thinking abilities,
      which Iâ€™ve found especially useful when working on IT tasks that require accuracy and step-by-step calculations.
      The confidence I gained in numeracy supports both my academic work and everyday life.
    </p>
<p>My final estimate: Level 2</p>
<h3>Here is my diploma from my math course. I've put it because a diploma is official evidence that I completed the course and met the required standards. By showing it in my portfolio, I give verifiable proof of my success, which builds credibility and trust with whoever is viewing my work.</h3>
