<p>In Unit 8 – Mobile App Development, I explored how mobile apps are designed, developed, and tested, focusing on integrating predefined code and custom assets to create functional applications. This unit taught me how mobile technology has become central in everyday life, and how developers use visual design, sound, and interactivity to meet user needs. As part of this unit, I created the Alphabet Learning App, which provides a fun and interactive way for children aged 3 to 7 to learn letter shapes and sounds.

The purpose of this app is to support early childhood learning by offering engaging activities that are both educational and enjoyable. I designed the interface with bright colors, large letters, and a child-friendly font to appeal to young users. Each screen includes features such as Sound buttons to hear letter pronunciations, a canvas for drawing in three different colors, and a Wipe button to clear drawings—tools that help children learn while having fun. The app avoids grading or scoring, which aligns with the client's requirement to create a positive, stress-free learning experience.

Throughout the project, I applied key skills like user interface design, simple coding, asset integration, and testing. I also gathered feedback from users to evaluate and refine the app. This project not only helped me develop practical skills in mobile app development, but it also demonstrated how software can be used to educate and inspire.</p>

<h3>Here is constrains I came across while developing the app. I've put this information this, because Constraints—such as limited time, device compatibility, or software limitations—are part of every real-world project. Explaining how I identified and worked around them shows that I can adapt and think critically when challenges arise.</h3>
<h2>Constraints I came across while developing the app</h2>
<p>While creating an Alphabet app, I encountered several significant constraints. One of them is Visual distractions. Children may get distracted by too many visuals on the screen at once. So I had to ensure that the images, buttons, and animations don't overcrowd the screen and make it hard for young users to focus.<br> 

Besides, It was quite complicated to make an ‘E for Earth’ and ‘C for Cat’ sound files that would sound phonetically correctly.<br>

Another constraint I came across while developing the app was that the sound wasn’t clear enough, and for some reason It didn’t want to pronounce some letters, so I had to look for another website that would be clear, free, and support all letters.<br> 

Also, children in this age range have short attention spans, so keeping interactions short and attractive while ensuring that they are learning is a challenge.<br> </p>
