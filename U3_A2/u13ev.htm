<p>In Unit 13 – Website Development, I explored how websites are planned, designed, built, and tested, with a focus on both technical functionality and creative presentation. This unit helped me understand how websites combine different elements—such as text, images, video, animation, and interactivity—to deliver information and services effectively. I learned how various components like client-side scripts, embedded media, and navigation menus work together to enhance the user experience. Through hands-on practice, I also gained insight into how websites support real-world business and communication needs.

As part of this unit, I developed the ‘Mobile World Station’ website—a fully functional, multi-page website designed for individuals aged 18 to 45 who are interested in exploring, comparing, and purchasing the latest mobile phones and accessories. The website is rich in content, including informative articles, multimedia assets, comparison tables, and interactive features. It spans nine internal pages, all styled consistently with a modern color palette of blue, white, grey, and hints of purple, ensuring a professional and appealing look.

The purpose of this website is to promote mobile devices, accessories, and services by providing clear and accessible information to help users make informed decisions. Designed to be a decision-making and informational platform, the website meets specific user requirements: quick loading, easy navigation, consistent visual style, and engaging features. It includes embedded multimedia such as videos, digital audio, animations, and scrolling image banners to maintain user interest. Interactive components like feedback and contact forms allow users to engage with the site and submit enquiries. Internal links and a well-structured menu system make the site intuitive to browse, while external links connect users to online forums and further resources.

Throughout the project, I applied key web development skills such as HTML and CSS coding, multimedia embedding, user interface design, and website testing. I also focused on making the site accessible and responsive to different devices. Feedback from users helped me refine the design and content. This project not only deepened my understanding of how websites are created and function but also gave me practical experience in building a digital product that is both functional and visually effective.</p>

<h3>Here is the constraints I came across while developing the website. Writing about constraints encourages me to reflect on my process: What worked, what didn’t, and what I would improve next time. This self-awareness can strengthen my future projects and helps make my portfolio deeper and more thoughtful.</h3>
<h2>Constraints I came across while developing the website</h2>
<p>While creating a website, I encountered several constraints that limited the features I could implement. Adding sound effects to buttons and actions proved too difficult, so I had to omit them. Additionally, working under a tight deadline constrained the scope of features I wanted to include to enhance the website's presentation. Implementing scrolling image animations was particularly difficult and time-consuming, further impacting the project's timeline. I also faced challenges with optimizing the website for different devices, as ensuring responsiveness on various screen sizes required additional testing and debugging. Besides, sourcing high-quality images and graphics that aligned with the website's theme was time-intensive, adding to the overall difficulty of the project. I also encountered the fact that my navigation on “Contact Us” did not match the navigation of the entire website which caused some misunderstanding among users.</p>
